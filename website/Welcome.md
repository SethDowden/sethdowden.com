# Welcome
## Here is a little more about me.

I work as an Economic Analyst at [WES](https://https://www.westernes.com/), a consulting firm specializing in housing, economic, and community planning development. I work on creating and maintaining data analysis pipelines, reporting, and data visualization. 

I am pursuing a Master of Science in Economics from Portland State University, focusing on Econometrics and urban economics.
