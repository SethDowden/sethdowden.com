# Welcome
## Here is a little more about me.

I work as an Economic Analyst at [WES](https://https://www.westernes.com/), a consulting firm specializing in housing, economic, and community development planning. I work on building out and maintaining data analysis pipelines, reporting, and data visualization. 

I am also Pursuing a Master of Science in Economics at Portland State University, focusing on quantitative economic analysis and urban economics.
